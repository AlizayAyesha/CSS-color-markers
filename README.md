# Colored Markers
This project demonstrates the creation of colored markers using HTML and CSS. Each marker consists of a cap and a sleeve, styled using CSS classes. The markers come in three different colors: red, green, and blue. The styling creates a gradient effect for each marker, giving the illusion of a colored marker.
